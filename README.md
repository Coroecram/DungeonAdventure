Ruby Dugeon Adventure

A text-based adventure game created to learn the Ruby language in practice.  
Overall, I am very proud of what I have accomplished in this game and would like to point out some of
the most notable features, in my opinion:

An intro which gives enough walkthrough the game for any new user to play.
Auto-fill commands and objects; unique abbreviations will call commands and objects
Ability to pick up and place objects from rooms and bag to or from bag.
20-Room dungeon, each room with unique doors and able to save and load the items within.
Move system which registers orientation and the unique doors within the room.
Interactive elements between objects which lead to completion of the game.
Novel methods for obtaining each object. (I tried not to be trite here.)
Separate timers for unique torches which burn out after 10 moves.
A light and dark system; if there is not a lit torch or lamp in the room, you enter into "the darkness".
