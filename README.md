Ruby Dugeon Adventure

A text-based adventure game created to learn the Ruby language in practice.  
The game-mechanic is to explore the "dungeon" collect the pieces and put them together to escape.


Overall, I am very proud of what I have accomplished in this game and would like to point out some of
the most notable features:

An intro which gives enough walkthrough the game for any new user to play.
Auto-fill commands and objects; unique abbreviations will call commands and objects
Ability to pick up and place objects from rooms and bag to or from bag.
20-Room dungeon, each room with unique doors and able to save and load the items within.
Move system which registers orientation and the unique doors within the room.
Interactive elements between objects which lead to completion of the game.
Novel methods for obtaining each object.
Separate timers for unique torches which burn out after 10 moves.
A light and dark system; if there is not a lit torch or lamp in the room, you enter into "the darkness" and have a limited number of tries to find light.

Through the game design process, I have learned much about the Ruby language. I have accomplished many things that I think will translate into the same complexity as any program I may work on. 
The things which I walked away with the most knowledge of are array and hash methods, and general debugging. Obviously, especially as a beginner, debugging Ruby code was the main hurdle I faced but unlike an experienced user, I also had to decipher what was going wrong.

Another few things that I have an appreciation for now are efficiency, object-oriented programming, and how programs are never "finished".  In terms of efficiency, I'm sure that there are many parts of my code which could be accomplished more efficiently. Tying into object-oriented programming, after working with the language for awhile I became more aware of and implemented methods that were general and could be used with other methods. Finally, in terms of a program never being "finished", there are many ways that I could make this program even more enjoyable, in-depth, and robust. On that same note, even things like imagining and perfecting user-experience played a key role in this program, as about 25% of my code is an introduction to the game... that being said, I do not feel 100% about my intro, nor do I think I ever will. 

I am very open to anyone's feedback on this project, if anyone ever sees it, as it is literally my first step into RUBY and any help is appreciated.



How to beat the game (for people who are fed up, I hope the game is easy enough to figure it out without this.):

First step, before completely cheating, find the fragment and then put it into the platform in the computer room. (put fragment) Hopefully, you can figure out the riddles there which will help you solve the puzzles.

Barring that, in short, you need to find the keyboard, the mouse, and the floppy disk and bring them to the room with the computer. Clean off the monitor and put the objects in the room. Inspect the monitor and see what happens.

To find the keyboard, mouse and floppy disk, you first need to find the room that they are in. I won't get into directions here but will tell you the keyboard is in the room with the chest, the mouse in the room with the hole, and the disk in the room with the ghost.

Take the cat to the room with the hole and put it on the ground. Inspect the room and there will be a cord coming out of the hole. That is the computer mouse; take it.

In the chest room, inspect the chest and then inspect the "keypad". This will bring up a prompt in which you simply need to write "QWERTY". Inspect the chest again and there will be a keyboard inside, take it.

In the room with the ghost, simply do not do anything for 10 seconds (STAND BRAVELY!) the ghost will disappear and the disk will appear in the ground.

There you have it.
